            <article>
            <p>My name is <strong>uzevie george</strong>,and from a young age i was always captivated by the possibilities that technology held.I found an interest in the realm of digital innovation,
    so with a curiosity to learn i delved into coding and programming,learning abit about the intricacies of the digital space as I could,before coming across alt-school.</p>
    <p>I was introduced to alt school Africa by my elder sister,being the first time hearing about the platform,
    i made some research on it.Seeing the courses it offered,and some of the success stories from people that had gone through the programme,i decided to join alt school.</p>
    <p>And as I reflect on my journey from an aspiring tech innovator,to an alt schooler on the cusp of making a difference,with a larger vision.I am filled with gratitude for the opportunities that have shaped my path.</p>
<p>And i believe that through dedication,resilience,a belief in one's self and an unwavering commitment to one's dreams,
            with perseverance,anything is achievable.</p>
